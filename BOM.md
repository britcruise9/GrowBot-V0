# GrowBot V0 Bill of Materials

This is everything on the robot in the video. It is the single cell, breadboard friendly build, not the V1 PCB (that is a separate board I am still working on). If you want to copy what is in the video, this is the list.

The whole thing comes in well under $100.

## Also needed (not electronics)

- **3D printed body.** The STLs are in [`mechanical/`](mechanical/stl_snapshot/). Print in PLA or PETG, a small amount, well under a spool.
- **Hookup wire and dupont jumpers** to wire it up per the diagram.
- **Mounting.** I skipped screws and just stuck the boards down with 3M double sided mounting squares. Fast, and easy to move things around.

| CSI | ribbon | camera (not GPIO) |

## Power

> [!CAUTION]
> V0 runs the servos and the Pi off one shared 5 V rail. A capacitor across the rail covers the voltage dips when the servos pull hard. This is the hacky part of V0; V1 separates them properly.

The 3.3 V for the IMU and the mic comes from the Pi's own 3.3 V pins, not from the booster.

## Setup notes (the stuff that gave me trouble)

1. Set the MT3608 to about 5.1 V with a multimeter before you connect the Pi. These boost modules ship turned up high.
2. The servos talk over the Pi's serial port, but the Pi uses it for other things by default. To hand it to the servos: add `dtoverlay=disable-bt` to `/boot/config.txt` (this frees the good serial port from Bluetooth), and in `raspi-config` turn the serial login off but leave the serial port itself on. After that the servos are on `/dev/serial0`.
3. The SCS0009 use big endian byte order for the 2 byte reads and writes. I assumed little endian at first and it silently read and wrote garbage.
4. Assign servo IDs 1 and 2 (both ship as ID 1, so you need to change one). This was a headache at first. The 3-pin servo lead is GND, VCC (5 V), DATA, but check your own servo's pinout before plugging in.
5. Torque limit the servos to about 70 percent so a double stall stays inside the MT3608's 2 A budget, otherwise use dedicated power for full load (a second MT3608 on the same ground).
6. Mic L/R to GND gives the left channel. The amp SD pin has to be high to play sound, so tie it to 3.3 V, and leaving the amp GAIN pin floating is about 9 dB.
7. The Pi Zero needs the narrow CSI ribbon (22 pin to 15 pin), not the standard camera ribbon.
8. The WS2812 data line needs root, so launch with `sudo`.

## Power budget

| Draw | Typical | Peak |
|------|--------:|-----:|
| Pi Zero 2 W | 200 mA | 400 mA |
| 2x SCS0009 (walking) | 400 mA | 1700 mA (both stalling) |
| Audio and LEDs | ~100 mA | ~400 mA |
| **Total** | **~700 mA** | **~2.1 A** |

The MT3608 is rated around 2 A, so normal walking is fine. A double stall goes over budget, which is why I torque limit the servos and added a capacitor to cover the dips.

Battery life is roughly 50 to 60 minutes of active play on an 800 to 1200 mAh cell.

## Software

The setup and calibration software is in [`setup/`](setup/). The learning agent and training code are still in development (V1).
